about: If you found a reproducible bug, submit it along with as much info as possible.

*Please include as much info as possible to save me (solo maintainer helping for free) some time. A [minimal, complete, and reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) is a must. Link to a gist if you don't feel like posting all the code inline. At the same time, please leave out unnecessary code so I don't need to wade through a hundred lines to get to the problematic part. Tell me your OS, FFmpeg version, etc. if there's even a slim chance of relevancy.*
