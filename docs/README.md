# Documentation Index

Welcome to the documentation for **terminal-media**, a powerful terminal image and video viewer written in Rust.

- [CLI Guide](cli/README.md) – installation, command reference, and practical examples for the `terminal-media` executable.
- [Library Guide](library/README.md) – crate architecture, APIs, feature flags, and integration patterns for embedding the renderer.

Both guides are self-contained. Start with the CLI guide if you plan to run the viewer directly; jump to the library guide if you're integrating the rendering pipeline into another Rust application.
